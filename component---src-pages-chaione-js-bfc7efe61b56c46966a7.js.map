Project Background</h1>\n\n          <h2>Internship @ ChaiOne, Inc.</h2>\n          <p>\n            In Fall 2020, I completed a <i>part-time</i>, <i>remote</i> internship as a User Researcher at ChaiOne, Inc. ChaiOne is a pioneer agency in Houston, TX that provides design thinking-led digital solutions to industrial businesses.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            During my internship, I led a user research project for <i>Tenzing</i>, a newly launched free web-app that is designed for academic researchers.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>The Product: Tenzing</h2>\n          <i>What is Tenzing? Why does it matter?</i>\n          <p>\n            Tenzing is a free Web-App that <b>helps academic researchers track who did what in a research project</b>. It allows researchers to generate reports about the contribution of each team member on a project, for insertion into their manuscripts, and for publishers to potentially incorporate into article metadata. It is developed by a team of professors and graduate students in Australia and Europe. It was launched just 1 month prior to my internship.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Tenzing is created under the broader vision of the <b>Open Science</b> movement in academia, which is a set of practices that increase the transparency and accessibility of scientific research.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As part of the Open Science effort, Tenzing promotes <b>transparency</b> in authors' contributions and responsibilities by encouraging open discussion on individual roles and authorship assignments.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n\n        {/* Research Objectives */}\n        <div className=\"section-block\">\n          <h1>2.

Research Process</h1>\n\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            For this case study, I would like to focus on how I successfully delivered impactful results for the first goal which is,\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"highlight title\">\n            Goal 1: Evaluate & Improve Tenzing's usability\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>Research Questions</h2>\n          <p>\n            Recap: Tenzing’s main function is for researchers on the same research project to log each of their contributions and create outputs that are suitable for journal submission or other desired usage.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The stakeholders want to encourage researchers to use Tenzing as part of the research management. Therefore, Tenzing should have <b>low learnability</b> and be free of blockers that discourage users from dropping out.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The primary research question for this project is\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            Can users successfully log in individual contributions and create desired outputs by following the instructions provided on the web-app, without additional help?\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>Methods Selection</h2>\n          <p>\n            I decided to do a combination of <b>Heuristic Evaluation</b> and <b>Moderated Usability Testing</b> to assess the usability of the website.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The reasons that I selected the combination of methods are:\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            1. Conducting Heuristic Evaluation first allows me to get <b>quick</b> first-round feedback to clients\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Since it takes time to recruit participants and conduct a usability test, a heuristic evaluation allows me to deliver quick results to external stakeholders, so that I could keep the stakeholders engaged in the process and set the right expectations. This is especially helpful when the stakeholders are external and not familiar with what a usability study entails.\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            2. Heuristic Evaluation helps me select the right tasks for Usability Testing\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Conducting heuristic evaluation prior to usability testing helps me understand the web-app in great detail so that I can create appropriate tasks that will exercise the entire interface, especially those areas where there may be vulnerabilities in usability.\n          </p>\n\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            3. Conducting a Heuristic Evaluation together with Usability Testing provides a more holistic evaluation of the web-app\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Since I might not be able to cover all the details of the web-app in usability testing time constraints. A heuristic evaluation can fill in the gaps on portions of the web-app that are not covered by the usability testing tasks.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>\n          <ul>\n            <li>\n              Used Nielson 10 Usability Heuristics as the criteria\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              3 researchers individually evaluated the interface\n            </li>\n            <li>\n              For every issue identified, each individual evaluator assigned a severity rating and an issue category\n            </li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <h2>Usability Testing</h2>\n          <h3>Recruitment</h3>\n          <p>\n            Tenzing’s target users are academic researchers including faculty researchers, graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Recruitment messages were sent out through university network, 5 participants were recruited for the study in less than 1 week.\n          </p>\n\n          <h3>Study Design</h3>\n          <p>\n            Recap: The primary research question was Can users understand the instructions on the web-app and follow the instructions to log in research project contributions and generate desired report?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            To generate a desired report through Tenzing, a user has to complete four steps, which are:\n          </p>\n          <ol>\n            <li>Create a blank Google spreadsheet from Tenzing’s template</li>\n            <li>Fill in the spreadsheet and Save</li>\n            <li>Upload the spreadsheet</li>\n            <li>Generate and download the desired output report</li>\n          </ol>\n          <p>\n            Instructions were already provided on the web-app as guidance for the users.\n          </p>\n\n          <p>\n            Instead of presenting the participants with multiple tasks with each step as an individual task, I decided to provide them ONE overarching task on their own that encompassed all the steps.\n          </p>\n          <p className=\"highlight medium\">\n            Such design minimized hints given to the participants through task instructions and mimicked the real-world scenario when users are using the website on their own. It also allowed me to assess whether the instructions reflect user's mental flow.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Moderated testing sessions were conducted remotely over Zoom. Participants were asked to think-aloud while completing the tasks.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Participants were given verbal and written instructions including:\n          </p>\n          <ul>\n            <li>an introductory scenario to a multi-step task</li>\n            <li>a PDF that contains proxy information that they would need in order to complete the task (see image on the right)</li>\n          </ul>\n\n          <h3>Metrics & Measures</h3>\n          <ThreeColumn>\n            <div>\n              <p>\n                <b>Self-Reported Metrics</b>\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                After the task was finished, participants were asked to rate:\n              </p>\n              <ul>\n                <li><b>Single Ease of Use (SEQ)</b> for each of the four steps in order to assess the difficulty of each specific step, help identify which steps are the most challenging ones</li>\n                <li><b>System Usability Scale (SUS)</b> for Tenzing in order to measure the subjective assessment of usability.
