          <h1>Hello ðŸ‘‹</h1>
          <p>I'm a UX researcher and product strategist with a background in psychology and human factors. I distinguish myself through diligent research, strategic thinking, entrepreneurial mindset.</p>
          <p>I enjoy navigating ambiguous problem spaces, solving complex problems with simple solutions, and drive innovation through actionable insights.</p>
          <p>My personal philosophy in UXR:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Research should be rigorous but also bold: years of experience being in startups and answering ambiguous questions have taught me to be resourceful, innovative, and goal-driven</li>
            <li>Research goes further with great collaboration: always be empathic, insightful, and action-driven with not just users but also partners. Problem gets solved by a team.</li>
            <li>Never be afraid to share, lead, and innovate: UXR has the best understanding of users and often great intuitions. Research enables me to be proactive in driving product innovation and taking strategic lead</li>
          </ul>
