Project Background</h1>\n          <p>\n            Honeybees are more than just honey. They are critical pollinators to one in every three bites of food we eat and contribute nearly $30 billion to US crop production alone. However, beekeepers in the U.S. lost an estimated 43.7% of the colonies in 2019 - 2020 (Bee Informed Partnership).

On the business side, the CEO wanted to better understand our target users (hobbyist beekeepers) and what motivates a beekeeper to purchase a remote monitoring device. On the product side, the UX team would like to know what features should be on the APP and which ones should be prioritized.\n          </p>\n\n          <h2>Research Questions</h2>\n          <p>\n            I broke the stakeholder's needs into specific research questions to guide the research process.

Reflections</h1>\n          <h2>\n            Speak the Language\n          </h2>\n          <p>\n            Be prepared for your audience. Getting brushed up on basic beekeeping knowledge and professional terms really helped pave the way to deeper conservations with beekeepers. Without knowing the beekeeping language, I wouldn’t be able to effectively understand the beekeeper’s working processes and emphasize with them. Understanding the language helped me facilitate my sessions efficiently and made building rapport with interviewees much easier.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Good Recruitment is Half the Success</h2>\n          <p>\n            Always recruit your participants wisely. I chose bee clubs as points of contact and ended up with very high response and participation rates. People who participate in clubs are almost guaranteed with high enthusiasm and willingness to share since bee clubs exist to spread beekeeping knowledge and build communities. They were eager to participate and were very willing to share their experiences and perspectives. Gathering information is much easier with “talkative” people.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another benefit of contacting bee clubs was the network effect. It is much easier to get in contact with other beekeepers in the club once an initial contact was established. This is also how I collected 115 responses for the survey in one week. It wouldn’t be possible without the established contact distributing the survey on our behalf. It also ensured that the survey data is trustworthy.\n          </p>\n          <h2>Engage the Stakeholders</h2>\n          <p>\n            I was very lucky that HiveTec has an emphasis on user research. Working directly with the CEO throughout the research process assured that my research was aligned with the business goals and the current stage needs. The CEO was also engaged in the interview sessions as an observer.
